# WindowsProtoApp
WX Python OpenPTC, Receiver and Protothrottle Windows Programmer UI

This program is designed to be an alternative to the raspberry pi based stand alone programmer.  The interface is a USB cable with an Xbee 'dongle' on the end. Plug that into your Windows PC and run this python program.

I have this program about 80% complete with this submit, feel free to download and mess with it if you like.
