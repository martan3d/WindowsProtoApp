# WindowsProtoApp
WX Python OpenPTC, Receiver and Protothrottle Windows Programmer UI

This program is designed to be an alternative to the raspberry pi based stand alone programmer.  The interface is a USB cable with an Xbee 'dongle' on the end. Plug that into your Windows PC and run this python program.

At this point, it is not finished and will only read from the receiver. It also is not a standalone sort of program, you need to know python basics if you want to play with it as is.  It requires Python3 and wx python.

When it's done, I'll make a standard sort of windows installer.
